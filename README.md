RSET students submit their certificates in RSMS website categorically for activity points. Finding out how much points one has accumulated so far is a hassle, as RSMS doesnt have a page that shows total points.  
This Python script solves the problem by automating login and scraping the RSMS website using Selenium & bs4 to calculate and display the total activity points gained by a student.  
Tracking of activity status is also incorporated- activities are displayed semester wise with status & points awarded for each activity.
