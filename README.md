RSET students submit their certificates in RSMS website categorically for activity points.
Finding out how much points one has accumulated so far is a hassle as RSMS doesnt have a page that shows total points.
This Python script solves the problem by scraping the RSMS website using Selenium & bs4 to calculate and display the total activity points gained by a student.
Tracking of activity status is also incorporated, activities are grouped semester wise.
